Hi, I am writing to this txt file from GitBash. I used vi hello.txt to enter.
This program will demonstrate some of the basics of Git
I will move this txt file to remote repository.
I will also create another file and move it to repository, but delete it
afterwards to practise everything I learnt. 
I will also be creating and deleting branches in git bash and then move
them to remote repository
There will also be an instance where I "pull" branches from remote repository to
local repository.
